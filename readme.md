# Beans #

A collection of specialized beans useful for extending ColdFusion objects.

To start, you'd download one (or more) of the beans in this project. Then you'd
use it as a base for your own code. Using the `extends="[CFC path]"` you can
profit from my hard work and tweaking.

**You're welcome.**
